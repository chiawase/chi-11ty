# Welcome to my side of the internet!

Hello there! I'm **Chi Se√±ires**. I'm currently a UX Designer at [Humanforce](https://humanforce.com). I'm also the current User Group Leader for [Friends of Figma, Philippines](https://friends.figma.com/philippines) and a Core Volunteer at [UXPH](https://uxph.org). I also co-founded these communities: [Tambayan 404](https://tambayan404.com), an online community for Filipinos in Tech to not talk about work, chill, and have fun; and [Pinay Bike Commuter Community](https://fb.com/groups/pinaybikecommutercommunity).
