# What I’m currently up to

> Last updated on {{ date_updated | readableDate }}.

### Stuff on my mind

- ~~I want to eventually put together my wishlist on my blog lol~~ too late, it’s already December and I end up buying all the things I want for myself anyways 😝 but maybe this can be a next year thing
- I just got my [hobonichi 5-year planner](https://shopee.ph/Hobonichi-5-Year-Planner-(2026-2030)-A6-and-A5-Sizes--i.1369393196.43966804861) and [posted about it](/blog/got-my-hobonichi-5-year-planner/) 😁 excited to use this next year!
- I recently bought [a smart ring](https://shopee.ph/Aolon-Ring-Gen3-Smart-Ring-5ATM-Swimming-Diving-Sports-Health-Records-Control-Video-Photo-Shooting-i.728957216.25733122589) and been testing it out the past couple of days. I might write a post about it here aside from also posting it on social media for my friends to see 😆
	- This is the highlight reel on my Instagram in case anyone was curious: [view Chi’s Instagram highlights for her Aolon ring experience](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18187289851344521/)
	- Update: just noting here that I have yet to write a post about my experience with this, but just to add a note here: I’m still using it mostly for sleep tracking haha

### Ideas to get back to

- **maybe I can just make a reading list that has those manga links below within them and I can have a place where I could dump my thoughts on them. Same with games lol** ← this is a priority!! 😤
- setting up the Webring for [Tambayan 404](https://tambayan404.com) members too haha
- I reaaally really want to make something like this but for my own life: [Life in Weeks](https://busterbenson.com/life-in-weeks)

### Games on my mind

- [Clair Obscur: Expedition 33](https://www.expedition33.com/) — replaying this on the PS5 Pro for better graphics 😎 and so I get all the things i missed haha
- [Ghost of Yotei](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/ghost-of-yotei/) — going through it again because of **New Game+** 😄
- [Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales](https://www.playstation.com/en-ph/games/marvels-spider-man-miles-morales/) — continuing where I left off
- [Hades 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145350/Hades_II/) — still ongoing! Got to the True Ending already though 😁
- [Umamusume: Pretty Derby](https://umamusume.com/) — I am back from time to time, but I’m not playing as daily as I used to
