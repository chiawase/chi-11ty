> This was initially written on March 5, 2025. I then made this particular blog post as my "test post" to see how static site generators would render the stuff I wrote in Markdown and then some.

Since using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) last year, I've always mulled over making use of this to host my writings and general thoughts I want to share to the world. But I first wanted to see if I'd stick to using it before committing to anything that was public-facing.

Now that I've established that I _can_ make use of [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) for writing some things down‚Äînot all though, I still haven't figured that part out for me, but enough that I do have some usage for it in my day-to-day life‚ÄîI want to now set up my website via this way, so I can have more control over my website again.

I've moved websites a lot in the past few years, from `chisenires.ph` to now `chisenires.design`, and I've stuck with it probably for... around 4 years already.

And after seeing [kepano's article on how they set up Obsidian for their use-case](https://stephango.com/vault), I figured I could try and emulate it. I also liked this post on calling [personal notes an ecosystem rather than a garden](https://www.threads.net/@kepano/post/DGwL0V_SBYw?xmt=AQGzmdhjbouy52clNn70ksBw4NftIi6kae0GCCyqKZv-UQ) and what survives is what sticks. I think that works best for me at the moment, given how fickle I can be in my motivation to write, or type, stuff down. But I am a yapper online regardless, I just... need a place to do so, and I want to make this place a bit more within my control rather than elsewhere (like [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ChiSenires) or other social media sites haha)

> These words are now written during the time I initially planned to publish this site. It was originally supposed to be on March 12, but... life got in the way üòù

I initially fiddled with setting this up with Jekyll, but I eventually just tried 11ty. I'm not too familiar with Nunjucks yet and `node_modules` and all that jazz, but... I guess this is a good long term setup + I'm also more familiar with JS than Go (e.g. for Hugo?).

Let's see. I'm also gonna be importing past posts I made while my site was hosted on Micro.blog via the RSS importer or something, so you might see posts dated before this article in my site too. Maybe I'll just add tags to those particular posts to note that they're archives or something. But for now, will be trying this setup moving forward. Hopefully this time around I actually write stuff down! üòÜ
