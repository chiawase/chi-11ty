outline
- reflecting about job title inflation in recent times
- based on personal experience, the teams where managers also did IC work were the ones that were fun to be in
	- in contrast, teams where managers only "managed" wasn't as fun and felt like the managers were far away
- IC work is still very important because at the end of the day that's the job that gets work done (for teams that are looking to have more impact)
	- but being a people manager on top of also doing IC work is challenging in itself
- reflect on career direction
	- i don't know if people management would be something i'd eventually want to be
	- i recognize that management is another skill entirely and shouldn't necessarily be the "next step" after you've gained experience as an IC doing the hard work
		- very traditional opinion
