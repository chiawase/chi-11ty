I constantly find myself wondering how much I should share online and where to share it, mostly because part of me is scared of bad actors who might take advantage of what I put out there (which I think is a valid concern...) but another part of me also just wants to be able to share just enough information so other like-minded people can also reach out and connect if they see my posts.

I was a constant oversharer back in the day. Back in college, I'm either livetweeting a class (which was partly how I took notes for some reason) or I'm laying out all the details of my love life to classmates I just met or friends of friends with the thinking that, _if I shared all these about me, maybe they'll also share stuff about them to me and open up!_ 

Yeah... no. Not really.

I would go on-off with what I share, both in person and online, sometimes detailing _all_ the details humanly possible with my memory, and other times just... saying vague things but without context it doesn't make sense or just not sharing anything at all.

The reason I'm mulling this over now and I felt compelled to post about it is because of my upcoming overseas trip. I initially wanted to post online, "hey, who else is going to this place on these dates?" and I _have_ posted these a few months before, but obviously not everyone's gonna remember that post with how fast the algorithm refreshes it. But now I find myself hesitating to post it again.

What am I worried about? Stalkers? I don't really have those, and I'd rather NOT have those. Exposing my live location? Would anyone care?

But I know it's always better to err on the side of caution for things that may cause harm to one's life, so... this post is just me letting these thoughts out as a way to reflect on them, but ultimately I'll just exercise caution. I do know to limit the audiences of certain things I share online, and I guess that's just gonna be the compromise I'll have to make do for now.
