So! I have been working on so many things these past few days, and upon tracing when the errors started to happen on my blog, everything was fine before 6 November 2025. When I tried updating and pushing changes to my my [now](/now/) page then, that’s the first instance when my deployment went back with a failed status.

I wrote about me troubleshooting the deployment errors in [[TIL of npm cross-platform support|this other post]], in case you were curious. But for this post, This would be more of a changelog type of post (at least until I get my own Changelog page if I’m not lazy to put it together lol)

In the order that I remember them, here are some of the things I’ve changed in my blog since 6 November 2025!

- I changed my website’s heading text to [Anybody](https://etceteratype.co/anybody) and body text to [Victor Mono](https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/) (which was originally the heading text before, but I liked the *italics* style so I’m settling with this one for now)
- I also updated my favicon to reflect the change of the heading and body, since I don’t even use Comic Sans Neue in my website haha
- I got to set the sorting of my [More](/more/) page alphabetically (instead of when I made the page)
- Made my blog’s header sticky to the top
- Added Backlinks in some of the posts that would link to other posts in my blog (so this post would have one, for example)
- I moved the dark mode toggle I used to have in my footer to the header and right next to my name, so it’s cute
- I set up my [Blog Stats page](/blog-stats/) using [PostGraph](https://postgraph.rknight.me/)
- made a buncha new posts (and this one I have checked the order, from earliest to latest):
	1. [[feeling giddy small changes|Feeling giddy about making small changes in code]]
	2. [[Another random list of things to share]]—this one is part of my [#8to](/tags/8to/) posts where I list 8 random things to share
	3. [[External links handling|setting up the marker for external links on my blog]]
	4. [[laptop stickers|learning about 2 sites that feature laptop covers with stickers]]
	5. [[TIL of npm cross-platform support]]
	6. and this one!
	
	Wow, that’s 6 new posts haha
- moved some stuff around my [About](/about/) and [Contact](/contact/) pages
- added that hover effect for the navlinks because I like the *italics*
- added some stuff in my [Stuff I Use](/stuff-i-use/) page
- also updated my [now](/now/) page, particularly the manga I’m reading because some of them already finished 🥺
- changed how my tags look like in posts and also added a `post_language` frontmatter thing to my posts in case I go Taglish when I write my stuff
- also updated how my post metadata shows up—now if the post doesn’t have a title, it won’t repeat the same data at the top anymore. That only happens if there’s a title in the post, since usually my no-title posts are short in nature 😆
- added Permalinks to my blog posts now just because
- something git-specific: I had to rebase my previous commits made while I was on my PC because the `author.name` was set to `chiawase` instead of `Chi Señires`, which was how it was set up on my work Mac, and I wanted to keep my name there 😆 super happy about [[omg I just learned about lazygit|lazygit]] because it made rebasing and updating the author name so easy 😁

Wew! So many changes done in the span of a week.

There are still so many things I wanna do—I was hoping I could figure out the “hosting images using a CDN” thing that I have queued on my TODO list for the longest time, but I’ve been a bit lazy in terms of understanding the coding aspect of that, though I think I understand the general concept of how to set it up now that it’s been sitting at the back of my head for the longest time 😆—but, like all the things I’ve been slowly setting up here, I’ll set them up in due time.

I even considered moving my whole setup to [Astro](https://astro.build/) just because I was getting frustrated with the “hurr durr can’t build your 11ty website” error when I hadn’t figured out the issue yet, and maybe in the future I would do it for the lolz, or maybe do it but for a different project. I dunno! That’s for future me to figure out. 😁

At the very least, I’m happy with where my site is at right now. I like tinkering with it, and I also like how easy it is for me to just post thoughts online and then have it out in the open, in a format I can mess around with.

For now, I shall get back to my games. I haven’t gotten to the true ending of [Hades 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145350/Hades_II/) yet, so… *moonlight guide me!* 🌝
