[UXPH Mini 2025](https://2025.uxph.org)‚Äôs 3rd leg just finished last Saturday, October 18, 2025. It first started in [Davao](https://2025.uxph.org/davao), which happened on August 23, 2025, then [Cebu](https://2025.uxph.org/cebu), which happened on September 27, 2025, then it ended in [Manila](https://2025.uxph.org/manila).

Initially, I was supposed to write one blog post for each experience, since they‚Äôre all different, but I ended up just doing this so I have one place to consolidate everything. (Also didn‚Äôt feel the urge to write about it until now.)

## The first rendition: UXPH Roadshow 2019

Last 2019, we already did this but called it something different: it was dubbed as the UXPH Roadshow, and the order was [Cebu](https://www.uxph.org/events/recap-uxph-roadshow-2019-cebu), [Davao](https://www.uxph.org/events/recap-uxph-roadshow-2019-davao), then [Manila](https://www.uxph.org/events/recap-uxph-roadshow-2019-manila). That time, I was the Marketing Pillar Lead AKA I was in charge of all social media posting before, during, and after the 3 events.

Now that we‚Äôve done it again, with an order that makes more sense‚Äîinstead of jumping from Visayas (Middle) then Mindanao (South) then Luzon (North-ish), we now started from Mindanao (South), then Visayas (Middle), then ended in Luzon (North-ish)‚ÄîI‚Äôm happy to say that UXPH still got it. üòÅ

## After 6 years, back at it again with UXPH Mini 2025

For this rendition in 2025, I joined as a workshop facilitator instead since I knew that‚Äôs what the focus was for this set of events. I did help out as a core volunteer too, though it was only for certain social media posts. I was relatively more hands-on in Davao because by then we were all still getting our bearings on how things should run, but I took a bit of a backseat in Cebu and Manila simply because there were already enough volunteers and it seemed like [UXPH](https://uxph.org) and the partner communities, [CebUXD](https://facebook.com/CebUXD) and [UX Davao](https://uxdavao.org/), had it in the bag.

### Workshop topic: a more hands-on version of a previous talk

I went the safe route and expounded on the contents of a talk I already did before on **Advanced Prototyping in Figma**. The talk itself was [an event did back in August 2024 with UX Davao](https://friends.figma.com/events/details/figma-philippines-presents-level-up-your-prototypes-in-figma/) and the feedback after this event was that people wanted a more hands-on approach on what I was talking about then. I figured, since we‚Äôre going back to Davao again this year, I‚Äôll use what I wrote there and just create something that attendees could follow along in their own devices.

In an attempt to summarize what I wanted to teach for this workshop, I essentially wanted to share that people can make prototypes feel a bit more interactive with the use of variables, interactive components, and things like conditionals that others may not be aware existed within Figma.

The working file was initially supposed to contain two sample prototypes: one for mobile and one for web. Contents on both prototypes were also supposed to be the same just so I could drive the idea that whatever things I was gonna teach about prototyping were applicable regardless of the platform you were gonna design on. I ended up just focusing on mobile though, because it was easier and faster to showcase üòÖ I started with mobile first and didn‚Äôt have enough time to fiddle and make sure the web version worked as good as the mobile one.

I made the workshop with a particular kind of designer in mind (which I also mentioned at the start of the lecture part of my workshop):
- someone who is part of a UX Design team (or maybe a sole designer) and doesn‚Äôt have the capacity at the moment to learn coding to create prototypes, or
- regardless of that previous point, whether they are part of a team where they only have access to Figma Design and don‚Äôt have the resources or time to check out other tools like Figma Make, Figma Sites, etc. to create prototypes.

This kind of designer was usually the type I got to work with in my previous jobs. I also essentially just workshop-fied what I would just randomly share to my teammates before when the need arose (and before we had stuff like Figma Make, Figma Sites, Lovable, v0, etc.).

### The first leg‚ÄîUXPH Mini 2025: Davao

My first version of the workshop was fully packed with 33 attendees, mostly students. Thankfully everyone had their own laptops even if we were assigned to a computer lab, and I initially just had 75 minutes for my total workshop proper.

Packing in all the things I wanted to teach and show within 75 minutes‚Äîplus considering I had to also help people get access to the Figma Pro Plan via FoFPH‚Äôs team temporarily‚Äîwas very difficult to say the least üòÖ I wasn‚Äôt sure if everyone got to follow all the things I was showing, and I resorted to just dictating every single thing I was doing. As soon as I finished my workshop, the volunteer assigned to assist me for my workshop told me that I was like a ‚Äúrapper‚Äù with how fast I was speaking and still being able to articulate myself üòÜ Don‚Äôt really know about that, but I do know I tend to babble, so maybe that‚Äôs just the positive spin on that üòõ
