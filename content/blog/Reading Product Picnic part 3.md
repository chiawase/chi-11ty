I only now am catching up to [Pavel's newsletter post](https://productpicnic.beehiiv.com/p/design-is-a-leadership-skill-why-design-goes-wrong-and-how-to-set-it-right-part-3) on this [now-4 part series (which I have a new article to catch up reading to)](https://productpicnic.beehiiv.com/p/design-without-feedback-is-theater-why-design-goes-wrong-and-how-to-set-it-right-part-4), and now I have a new set of open tabs to get back to because of all the related reading and other articles that seem interesting to me. ðŸ˜†

But the main reason I wanted to share this is because I resonate with this part of his writing, on where the design community is now after years of having ""Design Twitter"" and then that same online community seemingly disappearing:

> "... the conversation can happen everywhere you choose to have it."

The conversations can happen online, in whatever social media network you choose to stay and participate in. It can happen while you're out for dinner with friends and you all just so happen to be experienced in UX, but have opinions on where UX is going based on the things you've observed in your own teams and what you hear from those in other companies. Conversations can happen after you attend meetups, even if it's just to tell the people who spoke in front that, _"hi, I liked what you said about ... / I'm curious about ... / I don't agree with ..."_ It can happen within your personal social groups where people may be wondering how to get into UX coming from other jobs or careers. 

I hope more people, both locally where I'm based and elsewhere around the world, do take the time to write about UX and design based on their own experiences and knowledge in mediums that may be accessible to more people, and I also hope that we have the courage to have these conversations with others, especially if you don't agree with the ideas being brought about by others who may just be more vocal at the moment in the space.

(This is also a note to self in the sense that I hope I also get to writing more like this so I can share my thoughts online, in the hopes I can get back to it again and be like, _"huh, ganyan pala ako mag-isip noon"_ haha!)

_Last aside: gonna be trying this very manual way of doing [POSSE (Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere](https://indieweb.org/POSSE), since I do like the idea of having my thoughts, whether in long form or not, all be on my website, and then I just link them to other places I'm found on. For now though, I might just do it for my long(er) form thoughts since I'm still in the process of updating this website to match my needs ðŸ˜†_
