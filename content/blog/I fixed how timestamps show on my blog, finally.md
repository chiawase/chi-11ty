After much alt-tabbing between the [MomentJS](https://momentjscom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/moment/04-displaying/01-format/) docs and testing out the `filters.js` setup I haveâ€¦ I finally figured out why timestamps on my website werenâ€™t showing up correctly before.

â€¦ I was using the wrong token for **hour**. I used `hh:mm` in my Linter instead of `HH:mm`. Man, what a big difference capitalization gives you ðŸ™ˆ

Well now at least Iâ€™m sure that all the blog posts I have within my [blog](/blog) are timestamped correctly, and will be moving forward. It only tookâ€¦ around 5 months for me to see the bug ðŸ˜† hooray(?)!
