title: Another random list of things to share
description: I consumed a lot of media and shareable things today that I felt compelled to make another one of these posts.

This will probably be the first of this kind of post that has some embeds and images in them. Seems like in Obsidian the numbering doesn’t look right (they’re all `1.`s right now to my view as I write this) but on my website, it renders fine, so this should be okay 😁 

In the order that I remember them:

1. I watched [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNKqWaimAc0) talking about empathy for things and inanimate objects and went into a bit of a rabbit hole with the things it referenced in the video: there’s [this podcast of someone “interviewing” inanimate objects](https://www.everythingisalive.com/)—I think that’s a very cool thing to just do and there’s so many things you can do with this haha—then there’s this website on a [“literary and anthropological experiment” on how random objects can suddenly go up in value if there’s a story attached to it](https://significantobjects.com/) and that also sounds really interesting.
   
   {% youtube "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNKqWaimAc0", "Empathy for the Inanimate" %}
   
   Technically this item is 3 shared things in one thing… but I’ll continue 😆
   
2. I just got access to the closed beta of the revamped [digg.com](https://www.digg.com/), which, when I initially got in and started scrolling thru a bunch of posts on the website, I thought, “this feels very much like Reddit, what’s the difference?” but after seeing a reply in one of the posts in the `/digg` community (is it right to refer to it as such?) and after talking to other friends about it, then I learned that Reddit was _actually_ inspired by digg way back then, and also Facebook. 😮
   
   ![Screenshot of a reply to a post in the Digg beta version from user @pron which says, “Can anyone explain the main difference between Digg and Reddit?” and with user @forest, who is the original poster, replying with: “The current version of Digg shares some of the same primitives (communities, posts, etc.) but you'll start seein' the difference once we build a bit more of the foundation. You're early!”. Another user @BohemianIconoclast also replied: “Also good to remember that original Digg gave Reddit some of its best ideas, and gave Fakebook the idea of the Like button.”](../img/uploads/2025/Pasted%20image%2020251111133552.png "the yellow marked icons are my upvotes, or my “diggs” 😁")
   
3. I have this link saved on my PC browser: [Strudel REPL](https://strudel.cc/) because I want to test it out and see if I could do anything fancy with it. I just think it’s super neat that we have so much more technology now that can let us do so many cool things that before, seemed very hard to do!
   
4. I just got a new chair after maybe… 4 years? of having my old chair. I’ll share a photo of me in my old chair here below just to commemorate it. My new chair isn’t red, it’s black instead. I was hoping my new chair was also the same color, but when I got to try my boyfriend’s chair (which is the same as mine but is just gray, and he was the one who bought it first 😆) I figured it could solve some of the issues I have with how I sit on my desk. :))
   
   ![Screenshot of Chi’s Facebook post on March 22, 2021 of a photo, which is the 1236th photo out of 6006 in an unknown album, of a red computer chair that has a head rest, some built-in back support, arm rests, and locks for the individual roller casters for the chair’s feet. The chair is in Chi’s home bedroom when she still lived with her parents. The photo has a partial caption that reads: “yay my new chair arrived na (smiley) wala na akong (kukutkutin)” then gets truncated there.](../img/uploads/2025/IMG_1289.png "I just found this screenshot of a post of my chair from when I got it the first time 😆 RIP red Ofix chair 2021–2025")
   
5. I’ve been doing my best to keep a consistent streak with playing this web browser game called [Clues by Sam](https://cluesbysam.com/), and I super love the fact that I can finally play a game about figuring out who is the innocent or the criminal without having to install something that would show me ads after every run. I post about my daily finishes on [Threads](https://www.threads.com/@_chiawase/post/DQarXaCEvWW?xmt=AQF0pWuE6n7DqUBIwrMdD3KB-2-RS_6Mt0nfjGHhLOqw9A), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/chisenires.design/post/3m4ewlllohc2w), and [Mastodon](https://social.lol/@chi/115460791997658545) since I do like the format. :)) I even bought their 50 puzzle set one just because I wanna have something I could play with if I’m bored that’s just perpetually there.
   
6. And on a related note to the previous item, I also bought the paid version of Sudoku just so I can have a truly offline game on my phone. I love “speedrunning” it as much as I can. 😆 I’ve even unlocked the “Master” difficulty already since I do want to have a challenge from time to time. 😛
   
   I wish there was a way to share the stats I have on the app online somewhere, but for now I’ll just have to share these screenshots since it’s easier to put together alt text for them haha
   
   ![Screenshot of the Awards page of the Sudoku iPhone app, showing the Daily tab with 4 out of 6 trophies noting each month from November to June. The trophy for November has a progress bar underneath with 6 of 30 challenges finished, while June has 18 of 30 challenges finished. The trophies for July until October all have the note “Completed” below the month label.](../img/uploads/2025/IMG_3006(2).png "These are my stats so far as of 11 Nov 2025. Started playing around end of June to start of July 2025, and been playing since.")
   
   ![Screenshot of the Awards page of the Sudoku iPhone app, showing the Events tab with a total of 7 event badges. 5 of the badges shown are a bronze medal for participating in Tournaments. The latest one is for participating in a Water Sort event which ended on 29 September 2025, and the earliest badge if for participating in an (American) Independence Day event, which ended on 5 July 2025.](../img/uploads/2025/IMG_3007.png "I don’t track these as much since they require internet for me to participate in them, but it’s nice to see what events I did participate in haha")
   
7. Recently found out that special characters can technically be used in domain names, but they’d just have to be encoded with punycode. I saw an example in this [Punycode converter](https://www.charset.org/punycode) and now I’m thinking of making use of that knowledge for something… and no, it’s not gonna be for my own personal domain where I can spell my name correctly :))
   
8. Recently learned that my Baseform keyboard comes with rubber stoppers for its butt so it doesn’t rub surfaces badly and that it could stay put better. For a while when I got my keyboard, I wondered what the rubber sticky sheet was for, and when my boyfriend just shared in passing that he added some makeshift rubber stoppers under the base of my old Lily58 Pro split keeb—that he’s now using—that’s when it occurred to me that these might be for the keyboard (because yeah, it also came in the box, but there were no clear instructions so I didn’t know what to do with it 😝)
   
   Now it’s stuck underneath it. And it works wonders. Viola :))
   
   ![Two parts of Chi’s Baseform keyboard parts flipped to show its white 3d-printed base with black rubber pads stuck to some spots that show that something is supposed to go there. Also on her desk is her work Macbook with a bunch of stickers stuck on the clear casing, a Muji sketch notebook, and her Tambayan 404 deskmat. The used rubber sheet is also shown on the rightmost side, with the marked parts removed already.](../img/uploads/2025/Pasted%20image%2020251111142841.png "Also peek at my desk setup lolol it’s not super aligned, but I’ll take it 😆")

Alright, that’s all for today. I wrote this while in the middle of my working day because I didn’t want to forget what I wanted to share, so I’m happy at least it’s written down. But this may be shared at a later date since my site isn’t currently deploying properly. Hopefully that gets fixed soon.
