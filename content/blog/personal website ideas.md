Stumbled upon these two blog posts from James: [a list of 100 things to do for your personal website](https://jamesg.blog/2024/02/19/personal-website-ideas) and then [another 100 more ideas](https://jamesg.blog/2024/03/10/100-more-personal-website-ideas). Just adding it here as a post for me to maybe hopefully look back to and then add to this, if I did try some of the items listed?

In particular I think I could do the blogroll thing. I've seen that done by other people. Along with a bajillion other things.

Soon, in the future... ðŸ˜† I just think these things are neat.
