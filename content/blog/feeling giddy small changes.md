I really do feel giddy whenever I make a small change in code, whether that’s on my personal website now—been making lots of changes for the past few days? weeks? and I’m just also really excited to get them deployed—or with our internal design system code. I make small changes here and there, though, not to the point that I rewrite whole sections of it, but it feels nice to contribute to something.

I still have so many I want to accomplish, though. But I know that working on it bit by bit is better than just thinking about it and not being able to do anything at all.

Maybe, top of mind, I’ll list down the things I wanna do here. Maybe if I feel so inclined to do so, I’ll check back to this blog post and update the things I’ve noted down with links to the things I did, assuming I did get to do them.

In no particular order,

1. the [Life in Weeks](https://busterbenson.com/life-in-weeks) page that I keep remembering that I want to do
2. a Webring for [Tambayan 404](https://tambayan404.com) members
3. maybe surfacing my social posts somewhere else here
4. Archives being clearly marked as such (right now you can just access them via the [archive](/tags/archive/) tag)
5. putting my wishlist on here!!
6. Setting up that whole Cloudinary thing I mentioned before (which is already [listed as an Issue](https://github.com/chiawase/chi-11ty/issues/3) that I have not yet worked on zzz)

Okay that’s around 6 things. I guess that’s fine lol

Another thing: I still can’t decide on what tag to keep for these kinds of posts. [Writing](/tags/writing/)? [Thoughts](/tags/thoughts/)? Bleh. I’ll decide in the future then just merge one of these into the other. For now, I can’t be bothered as it’s almost 12am and I’m just enjoying the feeling of typing with my Baseform keyboard.

An aside, and before I end this post: I just read thru [this blog post on 11ty tips](https://davidea.st/articles/11ty-tips-i-wish-i-knew-from-the-start/#5-embrace-the-data-cascade) and I’m looking at the Data Cascade note in particular. That `goals.json` in particular made me think, what if I made use of the Data Cascade thing for more things i wanna list here on my website? (I mean, obviously that was the intention mentioned, but I’m thinking not just goals, maybe….. the wishlist could be one? 🧐)

Okay, it’s just struck midnight. I’m saving this now and hopefully I get to deploy this online soon so I can post about it on socials.
