OK, I was supposed to sleep after my last update and last commit, but as I was figuring out how to format my commits, my boyfriend told me, “why not use [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit)?”

And initially I was very hesitant because I thought it was gonna take me some time to (1) install and (2) learn how to use it. Plus, I’m not too familiar with a lot of vim bindings—whereas he very much lives in neovim[^1]—and it was supposed to be just 2 more commits and then I go to sleep.

He kept selling the idea of using lazygit to me since it’s what he uses, and even showed me an example on his laptop (since he was working on something else too) and… after testing it out, I am amazed. I get to still live in the terminal but I give myself an easier time instead of having to either: individually `git add` files I want to stage, or go `git add .` then `git restore --staged <filename>` or something 🙈

I just wanted to give space in my website to give kudos to lazygit because it was easy to follow with the always visible quick keybindings in the footer, and when typing `?` just shows all the keybindings and arrow keys also work. Perfect for someone like me who is still very visual but is not too intimidated with a CLI 😆

Alright, it’s 11:38 PM already where I’m at. I really am going to sleep now.

But after I do some `lazygit` again to push my changes and publish this blog post 😁
