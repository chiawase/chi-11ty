I’ve seen other people share the analytics to their personal websites publicly and initially wondered why one would do this, aside from I guess… transparency?

But either way, here’s mine since I have Umami set up with my site just as a way for me to see where people are viewing my blog posts from and which posts do get traction and such. I don’t really peek at this as often as I thought I was going to do though, but I’m happy it’s just set up and it’s simple enough to do so.

View my website analytics here: [chisenires.design website analytics on Umami](https://umami.chisenires.design/share/368agdyWC4Nl6Bat/chisenires.design)

I’m gonna add the link to this in my footer, too.
