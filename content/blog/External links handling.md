I’ve been wanting to work on this specific issue I listed as my TODO for my site for the longest time, and now I’m setting aside some time to work on it.

I’ll be mostly following the instructions indicated in [this article from CSS { In Real Life }](https://css-irl.info/styling-external-links-with-attribute-selectors/) so at least the implementation I’m using can be lightweight enough? And the fact that I link out to it can be my own way to test this while I set up the code for it 😄

And while I did end up following mostly the same instructions indicated in the linked post above, I opted to just get an SVG icon in Figma (I used one from the [MingCute icon set](https://www.mingcute.com/)) then ran the SVG code into [this URL-encoder for SVG](https://yoksel.github.io/url-encoder/) and then added those as CSS variables in my `index.css` file.

Now all my external links have indicators next to them! And I realize I do link out to several things lol. At least there are indicators now 😁
