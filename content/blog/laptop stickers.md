A friend shared this link in our Tambayan 404 `#coding-chatter` channel: [stickertop.art](https://stickertop.art/main/)

Seeing this project, I immediately went and took a photo of my laptop’s current set of stickers on it to submit 😆 The site has an “Upload your own laptop” link with a form on the site.

There are also playful “budol” and “naol” word emoji stickers among the mix.](../img/uploads/2025/IMG_3030.png "It’s full of Figma stickers because I got a lot saved up this past year haha plus obviously gonna feature Tambayan 404 too 😁")

Seeing this now though, I realize I don’t even have a [UXPH](https://uxph.org) reference on my laptop! That has to change soon. 😛

While looking thru the fediverse too, I saw that there’s a similar (if not exact same concept?) website that also just showcases laptop lids of people, which is [devlids.com](https://devlids.com). I’m submitting the same photo above there too :)) Their submission workflow is via email, so I guess I’ll just update this if I see my laptop has been added to the grid 😆 Each laptop (or I guess, each user?) gets their own page on the site so I can easily link back to it 😄
