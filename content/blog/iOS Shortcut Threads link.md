Duplicated this [[iOS Shortcut BlueSky link]] and made one to support `threads.com` links to turn them into `fixthreads.net`, since I do this manually anyway when I try to share Threads links in Discord.

If you're going to use this, it's only on iOS, and you'd just need to add it to your Share sheet. And instead of clicking "Copy link" when sharing a Threads post, you just go to "Share to" then select "Ready Threads Preview link" ðŸ˜„
