Duplicated this [[iOS Shortcut BlueSky link]] and made one to support `threads.com` links to turn them into `fixthreads.net`, since I do this manually anyway when I try to share Threads links in Discord.

You can get the Shortcut here: [Ready Threads Preview Link](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/3853dd1e2f9a4076b19cdea85d612108)

If you're going to use this, it's only on iOS, and you'd just need to add it to your Share sheet. And instead of clicking "Copy link" when sharing a Threads post, you just go to "Share to" then select "Ready Threads Preview link" ðŸ˜„
