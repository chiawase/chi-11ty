I finally wrote my website’s [[colophon]]!! Been wanting to do this for so long even though before I didn’t really understand what it was for. I thought it was similar to an Impressum or something (which I’d only see mentioned in Facebook Page details and until now, even though I know it’s something required in other countries, I don’t personally understand it) but I was mistaken 😆

[This discussion I had on Threads with an upperclassman of mine](https://www.threads.com/@_chiawase/post/DPD0iNtEhgF?xmt=AQF0eKoy1x6PJ6mvAoQSk248wDc0nDExk0TaKwJ3J1Um2A) sparked the urge in me to finally set up this Colophon page, and also as a way for me to add another page that I saw listed in [slashpages.net](https://slashpages.net/).

I wrote everything I figured I’d mention about my website’s set up so far, though admittedly it might be a bit verbose versus the other ones I saw online (like [this one from benji](https://www.benji.dog/colophon/)) (though [this one from Jim Ramsden](https://jimramsden.com/colophon) is also verbose like mine, so maybe I’m not too far off…). Either way, I think my website’s Colophon page embodies what I saw in this [IndieWeb wiki definition](https://indieweb.org/colophon):

> A **colophon** is a [page](https://indieweb.org/page "page") or section (typically in a footer) of a site that describes how the site is made, with what tools, supporting what technologies, and often published on personal sites at a top level /colophon page.

I remember back in the day that I first learned about _something like this_ from Ia’s [Imprint](https://stellify.net/imprint/) page on her website. At the time, I wasn’t too hard onto setting up my own website like how I am now, but since I knew a friend of mine had a setup like this on her own website (which I’m happy to see still lives on until now) then I feel like I am going in the right direction with what I’m setting up now 😄

I’m happy I keep updating my website like this. It feels very barebones but it also feels very… _me_ 😁 (since it’s my own ~~fuck ups~~ setup and things I’ve figured out after scouring through lots of things online 😆)

And before I forget, I’m gonna set up [this issue in my Github](https://github.com/chiawase/chi-11ty/issues/18) on figuring out how to make em dashes (—) look more distinct from en dashes (–) on my website. I think this is a limitation now with using [Inconsolata](https://levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html), since it _is_ a monospaced font… But oh well. That’s a problem for future me.

Keeping this text here so I can double check it in the future:

(—)(–)(-)

For now, I’m happy with the changes I have so far. 😁
