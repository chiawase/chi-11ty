> I initially intended for this post to be published on 3 Dec 2025, but I initially lost some things to share after writing about 2 things 🙈 Then as I kept trying to wrap up my list while it was less than 8 things, I ended up with… 8 things. So everything worked out well in the end lolol

1. Today is day… 5 of me using Linux as my daily driver. I wrote more about it in [this article I shared yesterday about my dual-boot to Linux experience](/blog/dual-boot-linux-pc/). Medyo finicky pa rin yung mga keyboard shortcuts sakin kasi I’m also still trying to commit the keyboard shortcuts on my Baseform keeb to memory. So far it helps that [ZMK Studio](https://zmk.dev/docs/features/studio) now works fine in my Linux setup 😁 di ko alam ano yung na tinker with ko with the input controllers and stuff—I think it was setting the environment variables then unsetting them that made it work??? maybe, I don’t remember anymore haha—pero at least now I can peek at the keyboard layout set sa keeb ko and maybe even change it in the future! 😄
2. Still trying to figure out how to fix and setup redirects with my Eleventy + Coolify setup. The hard part about fixing this particular issue is not necessarily in setting up the file—I *think* I have that covered already, it’s the server stuff that I’m not familiar with yet—it’s because when I work on these things with my website, it’s also usually around the time my boyfriend is already in rest mode, and he’s the one who set up the Coolify instance 😅 I’ve been reading the docs on Coolify and nixpacks (which is what is doing the `npm build`ing stuff for my static site) but I don’t think I have the permissions to access the things needed for those to work? I’ll also just need to remember to ask him again tomorrow, or whenever we both are still in “work” mode 😛 Isang magandang test case is my `/feed.xml` file, which dati pala (and I do remember naman, kasi binago ko haha) was set to `/feed/feed.xml`[^1]. I wanna see kung magpapakita yung `eleventy-redirects.njk` file na ginawa ko or if it’ll just show some generic page. Di ko pa sure, kasi I think hindi pa siya recognized nung server where my website runs as the reference for redirects 😅
3. While I’m slowly getting the cadence of doing my personal projects, doing my work, doing the things I want to do… I also need to learn how to *not* to anything. This has been something I struggle with, and feeling ko now I’m at that point na I get restless if I *don’t* do anything. (Maybe this is why I like tinkering with my website even if di ganun karami lagi naaasikaso ko… since it’s still *something*)
4. While I was trying to figure out if I could bring in iCloud on my Linux machine, I found out na may existing bug [rclone](https://rclone.org/iclouddrive/) (which I found out about when I searched for `icloud arch linux` haha) and the [only existing workaround](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/8587#issuecomment-3590852566) might only work for those na gumana na yung method before AKA nasetup na before the bug started happening. Also seeing that the workaround was only posted *5 days ago* (as of this writing) medyo wild lang yung pace on how things are in Linux wahaha
5. I’m keeping this list until here for now, as I really have run out of things to share about online for this week. Maybe for the next type of post like this, I’ll try to look for inspiration from how others do it (and maybe not take *too* long to put it together, so at least I still do it and it’s not stuck in my localhost limbo lol)
6. I wonder what the reasoning is for other people’s indie web setups where they really show… all their data online. Like, pati location? Number? personal contactable email? 😱 Like, I guess I get that for companies and businesses… but, wow, individual people? In this… very social economy? (just sharing this thought I have while I remember my thoughts while going thru [the microformats2 wiki](https://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2))
7. I super duper duper love [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWagM1FBB4c) about all the different kinds of cats out there! Watching it reminded me of the times I would just browse [this Amazing Cats picture book](https://www.amazon.com/Amazing-Eyewitness-Junior-Dorling-Kindersley/dp/0679806903) when I was young.

1. [Blooming Love](https://mangaplus.shueisha.co.jp/titles/100245) just published its last chapter early this week and I just want to say, I’m so happy that a manga about a more realistic portrayal of the coming-of-age kind of love high school to college students encounter is so refreshing to read in a sea of stories with lots of rehashed tropes. I mean, sure, this manga was also subverting tropes—the arts is the guy and the crafts is the girl, in this case—but with how their stories were laid out, it was nice to get a glimpse of this particular story. I’m happy to have witnessed it. I hope more people come to discover this hidden gem of a story 😌

I initially thought I wasn’t gonna finish this list with 8 things, but lo and behold! That’s it for this week. Maybe in the future I’ll add some automatic footer note so accessing the [8to tag](/tags/8to/) is easy and is also explained in a (maybe collapsible?) section. We’ll see in the future 🧐

[^1]: It was pointed out to me by someone on Mastodon, and they gave me the idea that *right, you* should *be able to set up redirects even for those kinds of files!*
