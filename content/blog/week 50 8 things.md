Okay, I *technically* wanted to finish this yesterday, but when I saw the time when I made this, it was already past 12 midnight so here I am just making sure I post it within the same day I made the post 😆

1. I updated my cursor to 



2. changed my linux cursor to golshi, but i had to edit it a bit, explain my matching with adwaita and learning about `ln -s` (which is setting up symlinks) + changed my sddm theme to https://github.com/uiriansan/SilentSDDM catpucchin-mocha ← do i just make this into its own post? 🤔
3. hopefully by the time i set this post up, i’ve made some progress setting up my `/media` section in my website, and i can talk about expedition 33 there
	- or, maybe talk about this? after looking into it https://www.kenmei.co/
4. share a friend’s comment that i am the “most likely to own a cat, but doesn’t“ person he knows and explain reasoning
5. talk about these two links?

	- https://chrisyoong.com/blog/the-100-150-or-200-characters-alt-text-rule-is-a-myth
6. talk about upcoming trips ? and the “jetsetter” comment by Les (pero don’t mention her name lol)
7. comment about how many notebooks and planners i have that i don’t know what to do with
8. maybe: share that you can quote a particular part of a message in telegram when you reply? and then think about how that relates to reacting to things online
9. also share about the clues by sam here, and also share the sentiment that being subbed to the newsletter has a bit of pressure included with it since i like keeping a streak, but i’m trying not to let it get to me too much and just be fine with it, after all, it’s a web game, and the fact that it’s just in my email is that it’s easy to get back to (assuming i get back to it…. lol)
10. maybe talk about the `history` command hahahah
11. maybe also talk about mulling over a monitor upgrade
