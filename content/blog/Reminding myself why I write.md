> Maybe once I’ve finished writing the draft blog post I have, I’ll link it here too. But for now, I’ll be referring to a particular blog post that is still in my drafts and I haven’t published yet. You might be able to see it in my repo, but it’s not yet “built” on my website.

While writing a draft blog post, I realize the length of it has gotten longer than I thought it was going to be. I just really have a lot of things to say, most times, and for that particular instance, I think it is properly warranted that I would write a lot of words.

I felt conscious about it though, because part of me would think, “but what about the readability factor of this?”

But as I had that thought, I also had to remind myself that the person I write for is myself. Or at least, that *should* be how I approach things here.

Ultimately, I’m putting these all together in the hopes that in the future, when I look back at the things I’ve done and reflect on the past, I have written accounts of what happened.

I used to be able to do that through the poetry and random musings I used to post on [my WordPress blog](https://chiawase.wordpress.com) (linking it here just to show that at some point it did exist, even if now I did mark it as private haha). I do plan to move the posts I have there into here, I just haven’t gotten to it and I plan to also style it in a way that it’s obviously from my past musings and was written during a different time in my life 😆 same with the stuff in my Archive for Micro.blog posts. But anyways…

It does feel nice to know that someone else reads the musings I put out here on the internet, though. More of a “oh hey this person took the time out of their day to hear/read what I had to say.” Regardless if they responded or not, it does feel nice to know that someone else took the time to look at these things. But I guess that is also human nature, in a way? Or maybe just part of my want for attention? lol

I’ve since learned to just accept that I do have these desires and tendencies and it’s alright either way. I don’t want to feel pressured doing something like this when the only person who would potentially be pressuring me would be myself.

So there. This is me writing to myself a reminder that whatever I publish or put here on my website, I’m putting it for me. It’s my mark on the Internet, whatever that may contribute.

> If ever you read up until this point, thanks for taking the time to hear (or read? heh) my thoughts. If you have thoughts you’d like to share, you can just [reach out online and mention this post](/contact) so I remember.
