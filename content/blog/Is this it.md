Is this iiiiiit? Am I finally gonna be sharing this online, and not just in my test domain?

Hopefully. I'll update this if I do. But for now, hello again internet.

My setup now is with using Obisidan to write these blog posts, then I'll build it by committing a message to my git repo then it _should_ auto post when it syncs.

Not as real time as it was when I still had this in micro.blog, but I'll manage for now. Maybe I'll eventually figure out a setup with Obisidan plugins or something. I know there's a git plugin, I just haven't gotten around to setting it up. And I wanna get this out already.

Na-figure out ko na yung problema ko from before on the images for the stuff in my `archive/` folder. Right now all my previous posts are just merged into the [Blog](/blog) section, but soon... I'll figure something out.

UPDATE: site is live na on `chisenires.design` as of March 30 woohoo! Now to slowly clean this up as the days go by ðŸ˜†
