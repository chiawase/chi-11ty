Since writing [[Setting up my website again for the nth time|my soft launch post]], I've made lots of small changes to how this site is built. 

A friend of mine informed me that the intro section I added in my home page was not working in light mode, so I spent today fixing the set up of toggling the light mode and dark mode. I personally prefer dark mode, but I also want to make sure my website is an example of the principles I am doing my best to promote, which is that it's accessible for everyone's set ups. That's one of the reasons I went with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) as my base setup anyway.

(This is my excuse to also just test the [interlinking plugin](https://github.com/photogabble/eleventy-plugin-interlinker/tree/main) I'm using to sorta mimic the wikilinks found when you have Obsidian set up locally.)
