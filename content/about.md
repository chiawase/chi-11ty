## Quick <abbr title="Getting to Know Me">GTKM</abbr>

- currently working at <a href="https://humanforce.com" class="p-org">Humanforce</a> as a UX Designer.
- I super duper love cats. But I don't own any.
- I am familiar with front-end web development. HTML & CSS are my jam!
- I do my best to familiarize myself with accessibility, especially for online things.

## What am I up to now?
My [/now](/now/) page has a list of the things I'm doing and taking note of so far.

I'm slowly adding stuff here and making this my own space on the Internet, but for now, you may find me online through any of the following links:

- [chi.omg.lol](https://chi.omg.lol) : My online business card
- [bento.me/chiawase](https://bento.me/chiawase) : my very own Bento linktree

... I've really added all my links in either one of those sites. Then eventually I'll link back to here once I add more posts on this side of the interwebs.
