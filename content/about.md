## Quick <abbr title="Getting to Know Me">GTKM</abbr>

- I have a red trifold Brompton folding bike I've named **Gold Ship**.
- currently working at <a href="https://humanforce.com" class="p-org">Humanforce</a> as a UX Designer.
- Most of my time working is within [Figma](https://figma.com). Though I also code occasionally now and contribute to our internal design system!
- I am familiar with front-end web development. HTML & CSS are my jam!
- I do my best to familiarize myself with accessibility, especially for online things.
- I super duper love cats. But I don't own any.

## What am I up to now?

My [/now](/now/) page has a list of the things I'm doing and taking note of so far.
