<div class="h-card">

Hello there! I'm <span class="p-name">**Chi Señires**</span>. I'm a <span class="p-job-title">UX Designer</span> from the <span class="p-country-name">Philippines</span>.

## Quick <abbr title="Getting to Know Me">GTKM</abbr>

- I have a red trifold Brompton folding bike I've named [**Gold Ship**](/stuff-i-use/#my-bicycle).
- currently working at <a href="https://humanforce.com" class="p-org">Humanforce</a> as a UX Designer.
- Most of my time working is within [Figma](https://figma.com). Though I also code occasionally now and contribute to our internal design system!
- I am familiar with front-end web development. HTML & CSS are my jam!
- I do my best to familiarize myself with accessibility, especially for online things.
- I super duper love cats. But I don't own any.

## What am I up to now?

My [/now](/now/) page has a list of the things I'm doing and taking note of so far.

## Communities I'm part of

While I do have a list of the communities I organize in my now page, I figured I should also just have a general list of which communities I participate in, regardless if I moderate / organize stuff there or I'm simply a member.

She’s wearing her red Lumos helmet, a red striped sleeveless top, and black shorts, smiling under the glow of nearby headlights." title="This photo was a bit amusing because it was taken as soon as someone was trying to make a U-turn on the road in front of me, ending up with them giving me a bit of lighting in the early evening 😆" width="500" class="chi-image">
