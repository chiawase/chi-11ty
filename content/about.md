Hello there! I'm **Chi Se√±ires**. I'm a UX Designer from the Philippines.

## Quick GTKM (get to know me)
- I have a red trifold folding bike I've named **Candy**.
- I love using [Figma, the collaborative design tool](https://figma.com).
- currently working at Humanforce as a UX Designer.
- I super duper love cats. But I don't own any.
- I am familiar with front-end web development. HTML & CSS are my jam!
- I do my best to familiarize myself with accessibility, especially for online things.

## What am I up to now?
My [/now](https://chisenires.design/now) page has a list of the things I'm doing and taking note of so far.

I'm slowly adding stuff here and making this my own space on the Internet, but for now, you may find me online through any of the following links:

- [bento.me/chiawase](https://bento.me/chiawase) : my very own Bento linktree
- [chi.omg.lol](https://chi.omg.lol) : My online business card

... I've really added all my links in either one of those sites. Then eventually I'll link back to here once I add more posts on this side of the interwebs.
