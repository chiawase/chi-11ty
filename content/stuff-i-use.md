## Stuff I Use

Initially put this together after seeing [Jarrod's](https://heydingus.net/gear) and [Robb's](https://rknight.me/blog/app-defaults/) lists, and eventually discovered there was a whole list of other people who did something similar. I copied the initial headings from [defaults.rknight.me](https://defaults.rknight.me/) and made do with the ones I wanted to note down, and added some of my own. 😄

Some of the links here may be referral links! I'll just mark them accordingly if there's anything special about them.

I eventually want to spiffy this up while getting some inspiration from these blogs: [Jason Burk's](https://grepjason.sh/mysetup)
