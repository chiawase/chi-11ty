ðŸ“· Day 18: fabric #mbsept

I know I already posted this outfit yesterday, but the prompt calls for fabric. So here it is. ðŸ˜†

<img src="uploads/2023/7662bb50c5734827b8e74d943fee2192.jpg" width="450" height="600" alt="Chi's full outfit. Her top is a cropped button top of what looks similar to blankets that were popularly used for bed when she was a child, with a black undergarment and a black skater skirt. She's also wearing black stockings and black boots, with her Figma two-toned orange and blue socks peeking above her boots. On her shoulder is her Figma grid tote bag.">
