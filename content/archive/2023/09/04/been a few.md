Been a few months since I went on micro.blog. I'm still wondering what setup I should have when writing long-form posts here.

When I'm on my PC, I default to the micro.blog site. It's fine if I'm just writing all text, but if I want to insert any images within my post, I feel some friction ðŸ˜… Still trying to figure out what would work best in this case.
