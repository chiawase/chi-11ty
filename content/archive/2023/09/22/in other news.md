In other news: I finished playing 🎮 Yakuza: Like a Dragon last night, like at around 1:40AM with how long the end cutscene was 😂

Now it makes me want to go back to my save in Yakuza 0, and slowly go through the series. 😁

Also excited for the [new game coming out in January 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpmYdgZc-bM)!
