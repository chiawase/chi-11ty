I found this glass of juice amusingly big. So I put my hand next to it to see the comparison in size ðŸ˜†

The size is as big and wide as her hand, which is positioned right next to the glass for comparison. In the background, her companion's drink is also visible: a red drink, but Chi forgot what it was.">
