I'm not that big of a fan of graffiti in general, but this was a striking wall. Felt compelled to take a photo. This photo has a lot of sections ðŸ˜†

<img src="/img/uploads/2023/f31f0091f019490692d81541f803ed31.jpg" width="450" height="600" alt="Chi in front of a gray wall at a parking lot area with the graffiti of the word OPTIMIST drawn with a red-maroon outline and small pink stars. Chi is wearing a black bucket hat, a green knitted top, black jogging pants, and black sneakers. Around her neck is a black KN95 mask tied to a red necklace. She has a red shawl repurposed to be like a cardigan over her shoulders. She is looking away from the photo, with one leg propped behind her, and her hands are in her pockets, suggesting that she is deep in thought.">
