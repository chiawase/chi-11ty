It's only been a few days since we finally got Figma access for our team at work and I feel so powerful. 2 deliverables I would've taken maybe more than a week to work on was now finished in 2 days ðŸ˜‚

All because I felt more at home with the tool, and I wasn't taking a break every 30 minutes or so after it either hangs, or I try to do something and it does something I didn't intend to do ðŸ¥²
