ðŸ“· Day 6: (oh) well #mbsept

This was a moment that got me to go, "oh well, I'm drenched in the rain, but at least I'm near home." ðŸ˜…

(I tried to see if I took any photos of actual wells, and... I have photos of other things with water, but not wells ðŸ˜†)

Both the poncho and her helmet are visibly drenched or have rain drops on them, and Chi's making a dejected or kind of exhausted face.">
