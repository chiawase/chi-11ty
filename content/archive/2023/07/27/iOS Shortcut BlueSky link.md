I made an iOS Shortcut that [prepares a preview-ready BlueSky link](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/2ca9f7d3c43148098fdf53ce4fbb8b63) (essentially just replaces _bsky.app_ to _psky.app_) in your Clipboard for easier sharing of BlueSky links that have embeds. Feel free to get this if you use BlueSky a lot.

I can now share cat photos to my boyfriend all within our chat and he gets context on what the link contains. ðŸ˜†
