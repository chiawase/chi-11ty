I feel a bit of grief over not using or updating in Twitter anymore, but only because at some point I did work hard to get my social graph to where it is now.

But considering what I want to do now, I can afford not to have it. I now just have to make sure all my other public-facing aspects show a part of who I am, based on what I want people to see. ðŸ˜Š

(this is mostly work- or career-related pondering, but I recognize it can apply to simply meeting new friends online hehe)

It's both a moment of sadness for losing something I knew as a certain way, and also a bit freeing considering the only limit to what I can do is my own imagination. ðŸ˜†
