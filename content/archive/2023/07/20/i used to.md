I used to tweet a lot about updates I'd notice on apps I use every day and compiled them all under the hashtag **#NoticingUpdates**. It even has [its own Instagram account](instagram.com/noticing.updates) now, but for a while I kinda stopped uploading stuff on it.

What if I set it up here on Micro.blog? Might be a neat collection (or archive?) of design patterns over the years. ðŸ¤” (Another 5 USD per month though... hmm.)
