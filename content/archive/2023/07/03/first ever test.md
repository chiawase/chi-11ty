Just trying to see how the functionality works here if I do try to post a more lengthier version of whatever it is I want to share.

My "first ever micro.blog post" became a bit of a blunder as I've been waiting for the post to be crossposted on Mastodon and BlueSky for a few minutes now lol

Now after typing more than 300 characters, the layout of the post creator turns into what I'm familiar with already: a post with a title I can set, and all the space for me to keep typing characters.

This is cool.
