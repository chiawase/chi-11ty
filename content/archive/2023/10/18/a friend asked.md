A friend asked me how I was and, after listing down all the things I know I've yet to do, like my presentation on smart and inclusive mobility that I have to present next week at a conference ðŸ˜± + visa application prep!!, I also wondered why I feel like... there's less structure in my days.

Then I remembered: Oh right, I bought a game recently. It has been living in my head rent-free ðŸ˜‚

I need to put it down for the next few days, though. Work mode for now :))
