Today served as a reminder for me that life is full of surprises.

I got to finish the things I dreaded the past few days and now I am just going with the flow of things.

Even my drawing is something I‚Äôm normally not comfy with: no shadows! But ok naman. üòÜ

The episodes seemed to have gone down again, but this time around it was only just for a bit. A few days. That was manageable for me.

And I always am grateful for my support system. I hope to pay it forward, when I can.
