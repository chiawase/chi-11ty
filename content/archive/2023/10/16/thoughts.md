Hello! Things have been going well so far. Slowly but surely I'm doing my best to be more deliberate with the things I do.

I'm working towards being more honest with myself, in terms of what I want to do, who I want to spend it with, and overall just taking care of myself.

Here's hoping next week is stable for me.
