the episodes have become weekly.
I find it a bit amusing that even my moods or emotions follow a 2-week sprint. I guess that's the effect of my work on me.
I wanna feel better, get better. I'm trying to be more honest with myself.
And also be more caring for my wellbeing.
After I do so, anyway, I feel lighter.
Sometimes I can get out of the rut by myself.
But usually. I do need help from others.
This is also another way:
just to share thoughts, unfiltered.
I hope I get in a better mental state. I hope I can get through the weight.
