Surprised to see my cousin ate Leira in this video! Happy there's a video talking about the history of video games in the Philippines, although I think they focused a bit too much on just consoles (as a non-console owner until 2017) ðŸ˜… Good job as well covering bootlegs ðŸ˜‚ I wish they featured more about the 1000-games-in-1 type of CDs that were popular at some point before hahaha
