I also just wanted to share this neat game I saw on Game Pass, and then eventually was gifted to on Steam: [Venba](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1491670/Venba/)! ðŸŽ®

I'm a sucker for cooking games, even if I don't really cook much myself ðŸ™ˆ The pastel art is also very cute, and the feature on Southern Indian cuisine is nice ðŸ˜„
