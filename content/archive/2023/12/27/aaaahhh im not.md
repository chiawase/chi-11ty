aaaahhh, I'm not that great of a tech support at home as I thought I was ðŸ˜† but this is within context of being out in stores hahaha

I work better when I'm near my PC and I can verify things on the go :))) oh well, I hope this works for my dad (he got a new monitor but realized he can only have 1 connected to an HDMI, but I know his NUC PC can handle 3 displays at most)
