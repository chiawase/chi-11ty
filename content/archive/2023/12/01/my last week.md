Finally back home to my unit after being at home with my parents for the week!

I was on leave for the whole week at work, because:
1. I'm trying to finish up my leaves, since I can't carry them over to next year
2. it was my parent's anniversary this week, and I also haven't been home for a while

I literally did nothing else at home but lie down and watch videos on my phone. I did bring my iPad, but I currently don't know where the other end of its charger is, so after I used up the batteries, I was too lazy to figure out charging it back up.

I also last minute attended a bike event on Wednesday. It technically can be considered historical for our local active mobility advocacy, considering that it was the Department of Health that spearheaded the bike to work activity with government officials with us, including the Secretary of DOH himself. After that short morning ride, all I did the rest of that day was rewatch the One Piece anime. üòÜ

For the rest of the days I was with my family, it was mostly what I expected would happen: my dad having a weird ass petty tantrum again, giving my mom the silent treatment, while we go out as a family to have lunch because it's their wedding anniversary. And my mom just taking it all and not saying anything since it's the "fastest" way to deal with the situation in the long run. lmao

all for show and no actions to reconcile with my mom or whatever.

I'm happy my mom and I ended the week with both of us going with her close friends to a hot spring spa üòå despite everything, that was a good way to end the week. I'm happy her catch up with her friends is now more frequent as well; I hope that she gets more and more of these breaks and times for herself where she can enjoy and do whatever she wants.
