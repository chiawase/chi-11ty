The text underneath the game title reads: &quot;If you said you spent all that time in Act One we'd believe you.&quot; Chi's stats show that she has 16% of Total Playtime with the game, with 21 Sessions Played and a 6 Day Streak. There's a vertical bar graph as well that shows the months of the year, and August is the only one with a bar shown, since Chi only really got to play it fully during the game's release in August. She also has a total of 20 achievements unlocked this year.">
