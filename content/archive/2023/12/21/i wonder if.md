I wonder if there's already a way to get a computer to check the characters of a post & see if it's ascii or emoji art then have that be read to screen readers

is ascii art quantifiable already in that way? ðŸ¤” I would imagine checking if something is emoji art might be simpler (?) but this is all speculation ðŸ˜‚
