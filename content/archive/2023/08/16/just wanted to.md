Just wanted to share that I was on GMA's I-Witness for a few seconds ðŸ˜† during one of the rides I joined to go to Pasig River, apparently sir Howie was tagging along wahaha

You can watch the documentary on YouTube: [www.youtube.com/live/cY0h...](https://www.youtube.com/live/cY0hfpCPtRs)
We show up at the near end hehe

I hope the I-Witness documentary covering Pasig River provides people some insight on what the (negative) effects of PAREX could be if the expressway project finishes (since it has some movement but as since stopped? for now??), and I hope it also gets more people to consider how we might make Pasig River be more alive, clean, and benefit the people ðŸ˜Š #IlogPasiglahin, ika nga hehe

![snippet from the I-Witness documentary, entitled Trip to Pasig, where Chi is seen wearing her signature red helmet and white crop top shirt and gray shorts standing right by the side of Pasig River with other bike commuters, prepping for their ride to Manila Boat Club. Seen on the left side wearing a black helmet and white shirt with the red I-Witness logo is Howie Severino, the documentary's narrator and who the camera was focused to.](https://chisenires.design/uploads/2023/3b010148ed.jpg)
