So far, since getting my trifold bike, I haven't booked an Angkas or JoyRide (motor taxi) to go to places by myself.

I've yet to see how I manage this when going out in evenings, though. One of the reasons why I opted for mototaxis instead of biking somewhere was time + activities I'll do there (potentially drinking). ðŸ¤”

So far I don't drink to get drunk though, just to enjoy a glass/bottle or two ðŸ˜† and I've even gone out late night with the bike, but so far only within 5~7(?) km.
