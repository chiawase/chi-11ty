Finally got to fix up the file and publish the [Slider Prototype Variations](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1277562905887280569/Slider-Prototype-Variations) on Figma Community. Hopefully this helps someone in the future when they're trying to figure out how to make smoother swipe-to-action prototypes on Figma. üòÅ
