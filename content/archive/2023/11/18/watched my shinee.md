While last minute, I watched the premiere showing of My SHINee World at SM Megamall. It was worth it ðŸ¥¹ðŸ¤§

In front of her are a photo of the SHINee members (from left to right): Onew, Taemin, Jonghyun, Key, and Minho all pointing a thumbs up to the right side during one of their concerts.

I didn't consider myself that much of a fan since all I've done was keep up with their music and know the members. But I think either way, they hold a special place in my heart and I'm happy to see how far they've gone all these years ðŸ˜ŒðŸ©µ 

Enjoying a group's music with other fans really makes the experience better, especially if you're all just there to celebrate the group members and what they do. I initially bought a seat that had no one next to me because I was a bit afraid of chatting up with other fans who might be more into the fandom than I wasâ€”I've always kept myself at the fringes, not really interacting with other people since I didn't initially see the need to back then.

I do have friends who are also fans though, and I finally got to introduce them to each other! So happy that they're now acquainted, and hopefully we meet up and hang more ðŸ˜„

I also got to know two of my other friend's friends, who were also new fans of SHINee. It was nice to just chat with people about their music and gush about them all together! I'm happy they were also super game with the shenanigans we did after the premiere, from the photo poses to the Tiktok dances we did to one of SHINee's latest songs. ðŸ˜†
