Where have I gone? Where else am I going?
Where ever I want. and  where ever I need.
But sometimes others ask me… . . . aren't you scared?

I am. But why should that be the norm? I just want to keep moving while I can. And maybe also serve as an example that it's doable by anyone. That one can be more free moving about on a bike. And one can ask for things to be better.

Some says it gets harder, but I hope eventually all our efforts to enact change have an impact in the future.

I just want to live. I don't want to be scared to live. I want to thrive while I am able.
