I'm wondering why Microsoft Teams  hasn't changed their functionality of typing emojis from using parentheses `()` to using colons `::`. Is it a remnant of old tech from Skype (?) and they just never bothered to change it? ðŸ¤”

In a world that's more used to using colons `:` for typing emojis, it's becoming more and more an outlier ðŸ˜†

I'm not even sure if that really was from Skype haha it's been so long since I've last used it that I don't remember much anymore ðŸ™ˆ please correct me if I'm wrong haha
