A great read on the opportunities for AI in accessibility: [alistapart.com/article/o...](https://alistapart.com/article/opportunities-for-ai-in-accessibility/)

It also has links to articles that are critical of AI as a tool, and I think that nuance is important when discussing this tool in particular.

Personally, I do align with this particular sentiment because it's also something I've wondered for a while: AI could be used to help make things more accessible on the web, or for our tech in general.
