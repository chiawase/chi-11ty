Made a mental note not to delete the spam messages I would get today before I left for my flight. Trying to see if there was a method to the madness.

SIM registration anuna haha this keeps happening and mas marami pa nga eh ðŸ«  kahapon din kasi it felt more pero I would delete (and occasionally block the number) when I got it. Now I'm thinking if I'll try to collate these numbers and then see if any numbers keep sending the same spam to me.
