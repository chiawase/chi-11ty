First full day in Austria ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¹!

there was a lot of walking, and just mostly getting used to the weather ðŸ˜†

Here is the before and after I realized I needed a thicker coat to not feel super cold in today's windy and cloudy day ðŸ˜†ðŸ™ˆðŸ¥¶

![Photo of Chi next to Salzach River. It is a sunny day, with some clouds seen but not blocking the sunlight. Chi is wearing shades, and a red puffer jacket hiding her outfit of a blue crop top that has the pattern of an old blanket from her childhood, a black turtleneck, and a black long skirt. She has her backpack behind her back. A row of leaf-less trees are seen behind her.](https://chisenires.design/uploads/2024/7f81ec2af2.jpg)

The sky is a dark blue, with more clouds in sight, and the sun has set already.](https://chisenires.design/uploads/2024/13e13f8b19.jpg)
