<img src="uploads/2024/image-2024-01-10-091902909.png" width="258" height="600" alt="Screenshot of the Micro.blog sidebar in Desktop view, which now has a darker gray background and is located at the leftmost side of the screen. Previously it had no background and was positioned to the left of the center container within the browser.">
