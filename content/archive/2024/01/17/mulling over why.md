Until now I struggle to find a reason why a team that has functioned and performed well even with a mostly-remote setup now changes into a more hybrid, more at-the-office setup for the team.

If the people we're working with aren't going to be at the office anyways, or will be busy doing other things, what's the point then?

There are also other more pressing matters that need deciding on and yet this is what they're more worried about?

what would be a compelling reason for one to change from mostly-remote to a more at the office kind of setup? can someone enlighten me?

this is within the context that your job is something that can be done on a device, and is only needed in a digital format.
