ðŸ”— [That Numbness Youâ€™re Feeling? Thereâ€™s a Word for It. || Adam Grant @ The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/01/opinion/israel-war-empathy-pain.html)

Reading through this made me realize how I think I've been overwhelming myself by going the empathic route _always_, and probably avoiding only sympathy.

Focusing on someone else's emotions is different from feeling them for yourself, and the latter can **and** will cause stress if always done.

I don't remember when I learned subconsciously not to only give sympathy; maybe it was when the trending discussion was to prioritize understanding how others might feel, as a means to help them (?).

I've known myself as an empathic person for a long time. What I normally struggle with is "not caring". On an added note, lately, a feeling of helplessness keeps coming back in waves; I usually don't know what to do with it when it's here, but once it ebbs away, I try to reframe it to remember that I can't do everything for everyone. And it is what it is.

Maybe that's kinda related to the compassion being explained here. Or how sympathy isn't all that bad, once grounded within oneself.
