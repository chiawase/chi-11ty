Looking through Google Maps now to familiarize myself with my Europe trip next week. I've already gone to the Salzburg Hauptbahnhof before because I've ridden the train then to go to Berlin, but now I need to figure out my route from the hbf to my hotel in Salzburg. ðŸ˜†

It's so refreshing to see wide sidewalks while tracing my route, and so many people were captured riding their bikes on Google Maps. There's also lots of bike parking everywhere. I'm so excited ðŸ¤©

I also learned that the inside of the hbf is included in Google Maps ðŸ˜† that's cool hahaha
