Obsidian pro-tip (and note to self): when embedding blocks from other notes, make sure there is an empty line before AND after your block notation.

So it should be...
```
[new line]
^like this
[new line]
```
with ample space(s) around it.

I was worried my weekly notes would forever have a bug for showing a certain section, until I simply added a new line underneath the block notation. It worked.
