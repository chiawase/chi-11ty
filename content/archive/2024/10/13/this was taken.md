This was taken yesterday at Design Week PH while I was waiting for mentees who wanted to do a folio review or wanted to ask questions about getting into or working in the UX Industry üòÅ 

Thanks to Design Center of the Philippines and UXPH for the opportunity to pay it forward to the local design and tech community üòä
