I'll also be at Singapore by the first week of July, because I'm attending [Figma Config APAC 2024](https://configapac.splashthat.com/) in-person ðŸ˜„

Will be my first time in Singapore, so I've been asking around for recommendations on things to do. Am also gonna be working remotely there, but contemplating if I should just file the rest of the week as PTO so I could explore a bit more ðŸ˜†
