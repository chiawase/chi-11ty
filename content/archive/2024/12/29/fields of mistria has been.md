[Fields of Mistria](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2142790/Fields_of_Mistria/) has been a blast so far, I love the fact that it's more forgiving in terms of combat or gathering stuff. All the characters are lovely, even the snarky ones, and there's so much to do. üòÜ

Happy my partner got me this as a Christmas gift ‚ò∫Ô∏è
