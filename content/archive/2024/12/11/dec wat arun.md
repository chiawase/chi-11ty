Dec 5, 2024 â€¢ Wat Arun Temple

it was really majestic to see in person. But it also made me painfully aware of how flat the terrain was, due to the late morning sun (when we went) ðŸ™ˆ 

last photo in this set was taken while we were on a river cruise along Chao Praya River and eating dinner!

<img src="/img/uploads/2024/7ba4268529.jpg" width="600" height="600" alt="A dramatic upward view of one of Wat Arun's iconic prangs (spires), showing its detailed Khmer-style architecture. The prang is decorated with intricate ceramic tiles and ornamental stuccoes in layers, with demon yaksha figures visible at its base. The spire rises against a blue sky with wispy clouds, creating a striking silhouette. Shot from below, the perspective emphasizes the tower's impressive height and detailed ornamentation."><img src="/img/uploads/2024/984860a48f.jpg" width="450" height="600" alt="Ornate exterior detail of a Thai Buddhist temple, showing a row of gilded columns decorated with intricate traditional Thai patterns. The columns feature gold-leafed serpent (naga) designs and diamond-patterned mosaic work in gold and white against a red roof trim. The image is shot from a low angle against a bright blue sky."><img src="/img/uploads/2024/0c334ed5f1.jpg" width="600" height="599" alt="Close-up view of a giant demon yaksha guardian figure at Wat Arun, shot from below. The figure is decorated with intricate ceramic mosaic tiles in various colors, standing against a background of floral mosaic patterns in green, white, and gold. The ornate details of the temple's spire can be seen rising behind the yaksha against a blue sky. The low angle emphasizes the imposing nature of the guardian statue and showcases the detailed ceramic work."><img src="/img/uploads/2024/1cdd303352.jpg" width="600" height="600" alt="Sunset view of Wat Arun from across the Chao Phraya River. The temple's iconic prangs are silhouetted against a dramatic orange and golden sky with scattered clouds. The river's choppy waters reflect the sunset's warm colors, creating golden ripples in the foreground. A pier with Thai and colored flags can be seen along the riverbank. This view captures why the temple is known as the Temple of Dawn, though photographed at dusk.">
