ðŸ“· Day 16: flÃ¢neur #mbApr

Was chilling outside the hotel on my first full day in Salzburg back in February. I asked my boyfriend to take this photo of me because I found it amusing that I'm so cold I need my jacket... but here I am, going out in slippers ðŸ˜† I needed to balance the temp ðŸ˜›

She's wearing a red puffer jacket and black leggings to keep warm, but also is seen wearing slippers.">
