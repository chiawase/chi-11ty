Dang, the accessibility description pop-up doesn't work on [Arc](https://arc.net) when making new posts via the Micro.blog website ðŸ˜¢ The page is just frozen until I change the tab.

I don't know whether to report this as a bug on Arc's end, or also on Micro.blog's end... ðŸ˜… But I have been noticing some overlays not working on Arc too, so I guess I'll include this in the list.
