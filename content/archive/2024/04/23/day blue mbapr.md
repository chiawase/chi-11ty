ðŸ“· Day 22: blue #mbApr

Taken last 24 June 2022. Second to the last gig I got to attend of [Banna Harbera](https://open.spotify.com/artist/53EF6PS4UcQwjNrpaE0968?si=JMWk_U6LRf6uJH9QffNWcQ) performing. They stopped putting new music out later that year too, but I was thankful I still got to attend some of the gigs when they were still playing. ðŸ¥¹
