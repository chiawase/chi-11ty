Took a photo of this mountain while riding a taxi with other tourists who were also figuring out how to get to Jioufen ðŸ˜† Taken last April 10, 2023!

<img src="/img/uploads/2024/26661cadaa.jpg" width="450" height="600" alt="A mountain covered with vegetation near Jioufen in Taiwan. A small thin cloud is seen on the tip of the mountain. A bus is seen on the right side of the photo because Chi took this as she was seated on the front passenger seat while going up the road.">
